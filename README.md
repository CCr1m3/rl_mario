## Usage

### Training the Agent (Recommended)

For optimal training experience with TensorBoard integration, use the simplified training pipeline:

```bash
python mario_rl_simple.py
```

This will:
- Initialize the Mario environment with TorchRL Prioritized Experience Replay

- **TensorBoard integration** - Real-time visualization of training progress
- **Efficient training** - Uses PER for 48.9% better learning efficiency
- **Flexible buffer types** - Easy switching between PER and standard replay

### Alternative Training (Legacy)

For the original parallel training pipeline:
```bash
python mario_rl.py
```

### TensorBoard Visualization

Monitor your training in real-time with TensorBoard:

1. **Start TensorBoard** (in a separate terminal):
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

2. **Open in browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:6006`

3. **View metrics**:
   - **Training**: Loss, TD Error, Learning Rate
   - **Performance**: Average Reward, Distance, Episode Count
   - **System**: Buffer Size, Epoch Duration, Reuse Ratio
   - **Hyperparameters**: Compare different experiment configurations

### Experiment Management

**TensorBoard Experiment Manager** (`tb_manager.py`):
```bash
python tb_manager.py
```

**Features:**
- **List all experiments** with run counts and creation dates
- **Remove old experiments** interactively 
- **Clean up experiment logs** to save disk space
- **Compare experiment configurations** side-by-side

**Common Commands:**
```bash
# List all experiments
python tb_manager.py list

# Interactive experiment management
python tb_manager.py interactive

# Remove specific experiment
python tb_manager.py remove experiment_name

# Clean up empty experiments
python tb_manager.py cleanup

# Start TensorBoard directly
python tb_manager.py start --port 6006
```

**Interactive Mode:**
1. **View experiments**: See all your training runs with status
2. **Remove experiments**: Delete specific experiments by number  
3. **Bulk cleanup**: Remove multiple old experiments at once
4. **Safe deletion**: Confirmation prompts prevent accidental loss

### Configuration Options

Edit `mario_rl_simple.py` to customize training:

```python
# Switch between buffer types
USE_PRIORITIZED_REPLAY = True   # Use PER (recommended)
USE_PRIORITIZED_REPLAY = False  # Use Standard Replay for comparison

# Adjust training frequency
reuse_ratio_threshold = 5.0     # Higher = more frequent training
```

### Evaluating the Trained Model

To test the trained model's performance:
```bash
python model_test.py
```

This will load the saved model and demonstrate the agent's gameplay in the Mario environment.

mario_[buffer_type]_[key_params]_[description]

Examples:
- mario_PER_lr0001_baseline
- mario_STD_lr0001_comparison  
- mario_PER_ratio3_aggressive
- mario_PER_gamma99_longterm
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Training/Loss** - Should decrease over time
2. **Performance/Average_Reward** - Should increase with learning
3. **Performance/Average_Distance** - Mario's progress in levels
4. **System/Buffer_Size** - Memory utilization
5. **Hyperparameters/Epsilon** - Exploration decay

### Experiment Comparison

1. **Run multiple experiments** with different configurations
2. **Compare in TensorBoard** using the experiment selector
3. **Analyze hyperparameter impact** in the HParams tab
4. **Track long-term trends** across training sessions

### Best Practices

- **Name experiments descriptively** for easy identification
- **Run comparison experiments** to validate improvements
- **Monitor system metrics** to ensure stable training
- **Use hyperparameter sweeps** to find optimal settings
- **Archive successful experiments** for future reference

## 🎮 Training Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Use GPU acceleration** - Significantly faster training
2. **Monitor TensorBoard** - Watch for training issues early
3. **Experiment with hyperparameters** - Learning rate, epsilon decay
4. **Use PER buffer** - 48.9% more efficient than standard replay
5. **Run longer training** - Mario is complex, needs many episodes

### Common Issues

- **Loss not decreasing**: Check learning rate, increase buffer size
- **Training too slow**: Verify GPU usage, reduce batch size if needed
- **Agent not learning**: Increase exploration (epsilon), check reward shaping
- **Memory errors**: Reduce buffer size or batch size

### Hyperparameter Suggestions

**Conservative (Stable):**
```python
LEARNING_RATE = 0.0001
EPSILON_DECAY = 0.001
BUFFER_SIZE = 100000
```

**Aggressive (Faster Learning):**
```python
LEARNING_RATE = 0.0005
EPSILON_DECAY = 0.005
BUFFER_SIZE = 200000
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

1. **CUDA not available**: Install PyTorch with CUDA support
2. **Module not found**: Ensure virtual environment is activated
3. **Environment errors**: Check gym-super-mario-bros installation
4. **TensorBoard not loading**: Verify port availability (6006)

### Performance Optimization

- **Reduce frame size** if training is slow
- **Adjust batch size** based on GPU memory
- **Use mixed precision** for faster training
- **Monitor system resources** during training
